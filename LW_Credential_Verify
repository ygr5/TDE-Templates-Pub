# Notes: Created with LW Template Maker v200806
# Fast running template to confirm token validity
# Returns 'number of marker category rows' of CustomerFullName.
# Need to use a Unique or Limit function on executing side to get only one result.

# Revisions
# 201209 Minor formatting updates
# 201207 Removed # [Filter]
  # Name = Equals("HQ")
    # Original intent was to limit the result to one row with this filter.
    # However, encountered an account with no HQ match which broke the result.
